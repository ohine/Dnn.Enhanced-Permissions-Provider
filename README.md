Enhanced Permissions Provider by Oliver Hine (nBrane, llc)
=================================
This provider will enable every permission available in DotNetNuke and the DNN Platform. By default, only the VIEW and EDIT permissions are configured out of the box. Installing our provider will enable the following:

Page Permissions: 
VIEW, NAV, CONTENT, IMPORT, EXPORT, MANAGE, EDIT (remapped to ADMIN)

Module Permissions:
VIEW, CONTENT, IMPORT, EXPORT, MANAGE, EDIT (remapped to ADMIN)

File System: 
WRITE, ADD, COPY, BROWSE, DELETE, MANAGE, READ

Built against DNN5.4.4 and supports every version after that. We have a specific version for DNN 7.2.1+ but the 5+ build will also work on DNN7+.
